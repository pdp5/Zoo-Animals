            The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
            Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
            ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as
            one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.

            The lion, known as the king of the jungle, exudes a majestic tone of
            power and grace. This magnificent predator, with its imposing mane
            and commanding presence, roams the savannas in pride. Its regal
            demeanor and strength define the very essence of wildlife’s
            hierarchy in every paragraph written about it.

            Monkeys are intelligent animals with large brains in relation to
            their body size. They are social animals, usually living in groups
            and demonstrating complex social behavior. Most monkeys are
            omnivores, supplementing a diet of fruit and foliage with a range of
            small and mid-sized animals.

            Large four-legged reptile with a long tail, short legs, a U-shaped
            snout, and a large mouth filled with conical, pointed teeth.
            Alligators are typically dark green to almost black in color. Their
            skin is tough and leathery, and there are rows of bony bumps
            protruding from their backs and down their tails.
